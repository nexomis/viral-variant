TODO:
    - input sample_sheet
    - convert coord in final smpl and batch var_file to annot coord
    - on final batch file: add depth for pos var at batch level but stable at 100% at smpl level (actually: empty + bamCov)
    - management of option (var_depth_min, var_best_prop_min, var_mpileup_subset, abra2_mapq)
    - filter smpl and batch ivar_file with min abundance (?)
    - bwa-mem instead of bowtie2_local
    - PSA: recalibrate PSA to non avoid to start by gaps
    - PSA: management of multi fasta
    - include public data set test
    - perform ABRA2 at batch level: management of workflow ([smpl -> batch] => [smpl -> batch -> smpl -> batch]), of bam out name (list of meta_id on meta ?) and of meta.type sample dependant.
    - version of sub_worflow wihout anny "Annot" in input
    - sumarize stats: % similarity PSA, % map, nb bases var (union & intersect)
    - VIZ: plot of variant
    - ABRA2 process: if meta.type not defined, the data will be considered as PE (and not SE), keep as is or extract the information from the bam?
    - if meta.rank_in_batch missing, implement with line number in csv (logic only if is missing for all sample of batch, but not really important)


*ok? 'FILTER_REGROUP_IVAR_VARIANTS' relation between both fils list based on file basename, same think between both templated scripts*
